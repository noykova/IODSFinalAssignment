The final assignment for the course Introduction to Open Data Science is described here. 

## Abstract

We have investigated two multivariate models for **human** data, concerning different measures about assessing development of a country. The models are created under the assumption that economic growth is not measured only by the gross national income. 
In the first model we have investigated the long healthy life as output variable depending on on education, income and mother mortality. The model analysis show that the choice of dependent variables is correct and the model is a good approximation to the observed data. 
In the second model we investigate the possibility to obtain good education as output model variable, depending on life expecancy, gender inequaity index and income. Surpasingly in this case the model show that income is not so significant variable and the output results do not become worst if we exclude it from the depending variables. 
We also have analysed the pairwise correlation plots and observe how the results are separated between proportion of female and male who have obtained secondary education.
